# Word Counter with MVC

#### By Matt Smith

## Description

A program that checks how frequently a word appears in a given string. The program will check for instances of only the complete word and return a count of how many instances of that complete word occur within a subsequent inputted string.


### Specs
| Spec | Input | Output |
| :-------------     | :------------- | :------------- |
| **Program stores the inputted key word and an inputted string to be compared**|  "bang" "bang" |  |
| **Program converts both key and comparative strings to lower to avoid case sensitivity**|  "BANG" "bang" | "**bang**" == "**bang**" |
| **Program recognizes punctuation and does not match**|  "were" "we're" | "**were**" =//= "**we're**" |
| **Program disregards and does not tally words that contain the keyword addended or otherwise different from inputted form of keyword**| "bang" "she bangs" | keyword (**bang**) =//= (**bangs**) |
| **Program continues to the end of the string after encountering an initial instance of the key word and records all separate subsequent instances**| "chitty chitty bang bang" | keyword "**bang**" = "**bang**, **bang**" |
| **When program reaches end of character array, it returns the number of keyword instances as an integer**| "chitty chitty bang bang" | Result: 2 |

## Known Bugs

1. The C# model program presently does not filter out non-alphabetic characters.  The filter allows for special characters to pass through given that they are adjacent to alphabetic characters.  Thus, "b@ng" would pass through whereas "#$%" would not.  Amusingly enough, in the program's present state, "b@ng" would throw a match if the corresponding compare sentence contained "b@ng"
1. as of right now, one can enter multiple words into the keyword field which will not be broken up.
